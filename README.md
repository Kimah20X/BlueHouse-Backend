JavaScript Promises, Async/Await & Error Handling

This project explores Promises, Async/Await, and Error Handling in JavaScript, which are essential for handling asynchronous operations efficiently.

1. Promises
   A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. It helps manage asynchronous tasks without deeply nested callbacks, making code cleaner and more readable.

2. Async & Await
   Async/Await is a modern way to write asynchronous code in JavaScript. It simplifies working with Promises by allowing developers to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous, improving readability and maintainability.

3. Error Handling
   Handling errors properly in asynchronous code is crucial to avoid unexpected failures. JavaScript provides: -`.catch()` method to handle rejected Promises.

- `try...catch` block to catch errors in `async` functions. -`finally` block to execute cleanup code regardless of success or failure.

Why These Concepts Matter

- Enhances readability and maintainability of asynchronous code.
- Prevents callback hell by replacing deeply nested callbacks with structured flow.
- Ensures better error handling and debugging in JavaScript applications.

Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6+)
